simtools provide facilities to simulate virtual ecosystems, from the
underlying environment to species distribution and scientific surveys.
Species can be simulated with a spatial point process using a resource
layer as reference, or by simulating individual movements (central place
or free ranging foraging). You can navigate the articles above detailing
each step:

- Simulate a virtual environment
- Simulate a species with spatial point process
- Simulate a species from individual movement
- Simulate an observation survey

The package also includes various functions (`%!in%` and `normalize()`)

## Installation

You can install the development version of simtools following:

``` r
# remotes::install_github("CLambert1/simtools")
```

## Access help and documentation

A dedicated website is available at
<https://CLambert1.github.io/simtools>, or by tipping `launch_help()` in
the console, which will launch the locally installed html documentation
in your web browser.
