simtools provide facilities to simulate virtual ecosystems, from the
underlying environment to species and sientific surveys. Species can
simulated with a spatial point process using a resource layer as
reference, or by simulating individual movements. The above articles
detail each step:

- Simulate a virtual environment
- Simulate a species with spatial point process
- Simulate a species from individual movement
- Simulate an observation survey
