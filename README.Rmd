simtools provide facilities to simulate virtual ecosystems, from the underlying environment to species distribution and scientific surveys. Species can be simulated with a spatial point process using a resource layer as reference, or by simulating individual movements (central place or free ranging foraging). You can navigate the articles above detailing each step:

- Simulate a virtual environment
- Simulate a species with spatial point process
- Simulate a species from individual movement
- Simulate an observation survey

The package also includes various functions (`%!in%` and `normalize()`)

## Installation

You can install the development version of simtools following:

```{r}
# remotes::install_github("CLambert1/simtools")
```

## Access help and documentation

A dedicated website is available at , or by tipping `launch_help()` in the console, which will launch the html documentation in your web browser.
